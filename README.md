# Bast-Universe
This project is similar to an aquarium that comprises a simulated physical environment, and a set of robots intended to interact together, as a community. The purpose of this project is to study how robots can learn alone and in group (socially). 
Please watch the videos and read the **Technical Report**, both in DEMO.
